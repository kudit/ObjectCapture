# ObjectCapture

Object Capture framework for including in apps that need Object Capture.

v1.0.1 2/4/2024 Renamed default AppModule target name so it would not conflict in included projects.
v1.0 2/3/2024 Pretty much a direct pull from the WWDC sample code, reorganizaed into a Swift Playground for editing on iPad and setting up as a package that can be included.
